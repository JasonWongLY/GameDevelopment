This project is about developing some mini game that existed or a whole new game. 

Currently, I am working on the TicTacToe-Ex game, it is a different version of the TicTacToe. It is about every player have three size of chess, and every size have two chesses.
A bigger size chess can replace the position of the smaller size. It is believe this version will have much more fun.
